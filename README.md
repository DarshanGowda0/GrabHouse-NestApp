We are planning to build a complete solution to solve the problems faced by the owners of houses on sale. We provide an interface for the prospect to be able to survey the house and request a digital key for the house, even if the owner is not present at the premises.<br/>
This proves as a solution to both the owner and the prospect, thus battling two problems at once.
